    <description summary="X primary selection emulation">
      Provides the ability to have a primary selection buffer to match that of
      the X server. This allows users to select bodies of text, and then paste
      them in another buffer without having to do the initial paste.

      The primary buffer manager is in charge of handling client's requests to
      indicate that text has been selection, along with handling client's access
      to selected text.

      <description summary="primary selection buffer is ready for reading">
        Sent when the client has permission to read from the primary selection
        buffer.

        This event is sent whenever the client receives a middle click, and will
        be received by the client before the actual middle click event. While
        the compositor is free to bind this event to another input event (such
        as a keyboard shortcut), the client should always treat pastes from the
        primary selection as middle clicks. This is to ensure the behavior is
        identical to that of primary selection pasting in X.

        It is up to the client to decide whether or not it is appropriate to
        read from the primary buffer and paste it's contents.
